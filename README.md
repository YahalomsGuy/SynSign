# SynSign
 
This repo was built to faciliate Yahalom Synsign with dynamically updating data, based of different RSSes 



Yahalom SynSign is a digital synage, powered by Xibo and optimized for multilingual speaking Synagogues, especially for Russian and English speaking synagogues.

most of the HTML files in this repository are used according to the needs of the different layouts and color schemes of the different places where SynsIgn was installed.

Therefore, Some of the pages may be unreadable (white color on white BG) 

Synsign usually consists of few static regions and few builtin regions supplying access to dynamic resources.

this repository fills in the voids, where the need of specific community needs dynamic data which I could not locate elsewhere.

project I am creating for a Synagogue in Moscow, Russia.

I have recently joined a jewish community in Moscow, and while visiting the synagogue, an idea to create a Digital signage came up. I have undertaken to donate the solution to this synagogue.
